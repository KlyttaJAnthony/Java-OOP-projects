by importing the name of the file on the powershell, we can run programs straight from the shell.

For instance:

If we ran the quadratic_formula.py, the powershell will run the code. 

If we want to find the function itself, we can run the quadratic_formula.coefficient_input() (coefficient_input is a function within the program).




Java does not have any lists or tuples. Instead, Java has only arrays. 
	Arrays are fixed size, and all entries are the same data type. Otherwise, all else the same as lists.
